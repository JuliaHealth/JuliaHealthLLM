> Create cohorts from databases utilizing the OMOP CDM.

This is a **work in progress package** that allows one to interface with an OMOP CDM database for observational health research and analytics.
This package works on version 5.4 of the OMOP CDM and provides a number of filters and getter functions.

For questions, feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/discussions), create an [issue](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/issues), or post on [Zulip](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/discussions).

This package uses a functional approach to query databases in the [OMOP Common Data Model format](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/) whereby you could build rapidly lines of inquiry into the database.
Furthermore, this package is a companion to those tools found in the [HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/) ecosystem.
Documentation has been set up [so please check them out](https://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl)!
To get started, visit the [Tutorials](https://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/tutorials) section as well as visit the [API](https://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/api) section to see all the functions available.

# Main Features üîß

The biggest features of this package are:

- Incremental building blocks for creating an analysis pipeline in the form of (more information in [API](https://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/api)):
  - "Getter" functions to "get" information from a database 
  - "Filter" functions to "filter" information from a database 
  - "Generator" functions to "generate" database information and connections
  - "Executor" functions to "execute" on retrieved information 
- Automatic targeting and support for the SQL flavors (via [FunSQL.jl](https://mechanicalrabbit.github.io/FunSQL.jl/)):
  - `postgresql`
  - `sqlite`
  - `redshift`
- Prepare SQL queries if unable to connect to database via OMOPCDMCohortCreator that could then be run on a given SQL database directly
- Does not mutate database or require temp tables
- Interoperable with the R language via [JuliaConnectoR](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR) to work directly within R syntax (see [Tutorials](https://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/tutorials))
- Readily parallelizable via [Distributed.jl](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/distributed-computing/)
- Complementary to [OHDSI HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/) ecosystem tools
- Extensive [test suite](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/tree/main/test) to ensure correctness and compliance with privacy preserving methods (HITECH, etc.)
