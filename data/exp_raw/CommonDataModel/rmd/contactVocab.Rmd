Okay so you have something you would like to add to the CDM but there is not an existing OMOP vocabulary nor an open-source vocabulary we can bring in to support it. **In this case, please contact the vocabulary team on next steps** as data elements in the CDM must have a vocabulary in place before they can be implemented. 

[Vocabulary Teams Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a31208179438d45749ff484124e7b1e5e%40thread.tacv2/Vocabulary%2520Subgroup?groupId=a6f2c516-e568-4974-8f1e-a7bdc2f997c5&tenantId=a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5)

Once you come to consensus with the vocabulary team regarding your needs, please follow the [CDM Request Process](cdmRequestProcess.html) to begin the steps soliciting a change or addition to the model itself. Need more guidance? Consider contacting the CDM Working Group on our [GitHub](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel) or [Teams Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a133f2b94b86a41a884d4a4d160610148%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=a6f2c516-e568-4974-8f1e-a7bdc2f997c5&tenantId=a30f0094-9120-4aab-ba4c-e5509023b2d5).
