Okay, so you have a use case but you don't have an OMOP vocabulary to support your need. **Is there an existing open-source (not proprietary or custom) vocabulary that has not yet been incorporated into the OMOP vocabulary?**

[Yes, the vocabulary exists, it just needs to be brought in](vocabRequest.html)

[No, there is no open-source vocabulary for this data element](contactVocab.html)
